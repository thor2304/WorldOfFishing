/**
 * <h2>This is the class responsible for everything displayed to the player</h2>
 * <h2>
 * How to Use: </h2>
 * <h3>When displaying using existing functions:</h3>
 * Make sure an instance of {@link DisplayToPlayer} exists, good practice is to call it display
 * <p> use this instance to call the desired method</p>
 * If you only need to display a simple message with a string you <b><i>can</i></b> use
 * {@link #displaySimpleInfo(String)} but you <b>really</b> should consider if it is a type of message which will be displayed
 * in a special way in iteration 2
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <h3>Display with a new function</h3>
 * Good practice when modifying this class consists of 3 steps:
 * <p><b>Step 0: </b></p>
 * Do a <i><b>Git commit</b></i> with your current work, so the changes in this class exist in a separate commit.
 * This makes it easier to troubleshoot if it doesnt work!
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <p><b>Step 1: </b></p>
 * Create an interface with a fitting name that describes the method(s) to implement.
 * This interface should be put in the package DisplayInterfaces.(an example of this is {@link DisplaySimpleInfo})
 * and should ideally have a <b>docstring</b> with information
 * about what information should be displayed by the methods when implemented
 * <p>
 * An interface cannot describe static methods (as far as our testing goes),
 * so avoid that when describing your interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Remember to add the interface to the list of implemented interfaces in {@link DisplayToPlayer}
 * </p>
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <p><b>Step 2: </b></p>
 * Implement the method in DisplayToPlayer.
 * <p>
 * if you are just being thorough and implementing a seperate method for a simple Display of a string
 * feel free to use {@link #displaySimpleInfo(String)} as this help make the transition to iteration 2 smoother
 * </p>
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <p><b>Step 3: </b></p>
 * Remember to call your beautiful new method from the class you want,
 * see the point in this doc called <i>When displaying using existing functions:</i> for info on how to make that work.
 * <p>
 * The very last thing to do is to make a <b><i>Git commit</i></b> with the final result of this change, remember to include:
 * the name of your new Interface and perhaps your new method. This makes it easier to Code review
 * </p>
