# About the project
WorldOfFishing is based on a framework provided by SDU  
In the bottom of the ReadME, you can read the original authors notes associated with the framework.  

##Running the project
The project is dependent on JavaFX, which means you have to have a working runtime for JavaFX installed.  
Alternatively run it through an IDE. We used IntelliJ nad loaded JavaFX through Maven.

###Releases
Your best chance of getting the project running is by downloading a release.  
**V1** is textbased, per demands from the project structure, delivered by SDU.  
**V2** has a graphical user interface, and is the version recommended by us.

This project is a simple framework for an adventure game.
In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.

That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.


This project was written to illustrate the use of enums to support
language independence of the game logic.
